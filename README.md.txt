# 🧠 AI-Powered Medical Image Analysis System

## 📌 Overview

This project implements an AI-powered medical image analysis system that detects pneumonia from chest X-ray images using deep learning.

The model uses **MobileNetV2 Transfer Learning** to classify medical images into:

- NORMAL
- PNEUMONIA

This system simulates real-world hospital diagnostic workflows.

---

## 🏥 Problem Statement

Manual diagnosis of chest X-ray images is time-consuming and prone to human error.

Hospitals generate thousands of X-ray images daily.

This project uses deep learning to:

- Automate pneumonia detection
- Reduce diagnosis time
- Assist radiologists
- Improve accuracy

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build an AI model for pneumonia detection
- Use transfer learning for medical image classification
- Visualize performance metrics
- Simulate real healthcare workflows
